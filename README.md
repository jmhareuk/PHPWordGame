# PHP Word Game
A word game using PHP concepts. Allows the user to specifiy a number (from 2 - 6) of random letters. The game will then create all permutations and substrings of those letters, which are then checked against a dictionary file for possible words. Finally, the user is shown all words that can be made from the randomly selected letters.
